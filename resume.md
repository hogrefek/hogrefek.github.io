## Summary
I'm well suited for this positon due the computer modeling skills and deep understanding of how humankind and the environment interact in complex social-ecological systems that I've developed in pursuit of my PhD.  I'm also well versed in GIS and Remote Sesnsing technologies due to my MS in Geography and subsequesnt work for the U.S. Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center.  In serving as _Geospatial Science Coordinator for US Forest Service Region 6_ I will bring these talents to bare on the agencies research and resource management prioirities by ....

### Work Experience (Last 10 years)

__Oregon State University: 9/2016 - Present__
__Corvallis, Oregon, USA__
__Teaching Assistant / PhD Candidate__
Secured 3 years of funding for my attendance at OSU as a PhD student/candidate as a Teaching Assistant helping to instruct Remote Sensing and GIS courses.  In pursuit of my PhD research I secured additional funding from multiple sources to support my actual research and coordinated amongst multiple federal, state, university, and private entities to complete my research goals.
(I need new material describing this – but I’m still doing “this” and am apporaching this assignment as a draft.)

__U.S. Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center: 9/2009 – 8/2016__
__Anchorage, Alaska, USA__
__Geographer__
Researched the spatial and temporal dynamics of habitat distribution and quality across the landscape, in Arctic ecosystems. Integrated satellite imagery, aerial photography, GIS datasets and field survey data to map the distribution of habitat variability across the landscape and model the environmental drivers of that diversity. Coordinated multiple research expeditions lasting up to 3 months in both marine and terrestrial environments to collect in-situ ecological data using various field survey methods. Mapped the distribution of eelgrass meadows, coastal habitat critical to migratory waterfowl, adjacent to National Wildlife Refuges in Southwest Alaska. Operated remote arctic research camps investigating the impacts of climate change to the reproductive success of migratory birds. Lead research to map salt marsh habitat and use NDVI to predict the biomass and nutrients it provides during reproduction. Collaborated with USGS and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff and multiple local entities.

__Gaia Geo-Analytical: 4/2008 – 9/2009__
__Corvallis, Oregon, USA__
__Owner / GIS and Remote Sensing Specialist__
Analyzed IKONOS satellite imagery and other datasets to derive depth in shallow waters at sites across the Pacific Ocean. Integrated derived bathymetry products with multibeam sonar bathymetry to map nearshore terrain and coral reef structure. Delivered finished product packages, including raster grids of integrated bathymetry, error analyses and metadata. Created Gaia Geo-Analytical to foster this work under contract with NOAA's Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, Coral Reef Ecosystem Division, and the Pacific Islands Benthic Habitat Mapping Center.

 As Research Assistant I helped developed a website dedicated to the standardization of the metadata protocols used in marine GIS and Remote Sensing, otherwise I focused on the following Accomplishments.

- Obtained **MS of Geography**.
- Established and published a method (drawing peer reviewed research) to derive nearshore bathymetric data from satellite imagery.
- Integrated nearshore derived bathymetry with offshore multibeam sonar data and terrestrial digital elevation models to create seamless datasets of island terrain.
- Modeled the impact of island development and intensified land use on multiple indicators of coral reef vitality.
